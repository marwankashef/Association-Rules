# Association Rules

Using the association_rules function from the mlxtend library, a full list of association rules was generated for the itemsets. From this list, further analysis was completed to provide an example fitting each of the bottom scenarios. The min threshold for confidence and support was set fairly low to allow for as many cases to be accounted for as possible.
